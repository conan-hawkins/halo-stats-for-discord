This code is for my own personal use. I do not have premision to pull information from halotracker.com.

This bot pulls information from the front end of the website then takes a screenshot and uploads it to discord.

Command prefix = #

Commands
#ranked = pulls all basic ranked stats
#stats  = pulls all basic halo stats, ranked and casual
#help   = gives basic bot information
