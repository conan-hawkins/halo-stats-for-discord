This code is for my own personal use. I do not have premision to pull information from halotracker.com.
This bot pulls information from the front end of halotracker.com using CSS selectors and uploads it to discord.

Commands prefix = #

#ranked = pulls all basic ranked stats.    <---->    example #ranked 'gamertag'

#stats  = pulls all basic halo stats, ranked and casual.    <---->    example #stats 'gamertag'

#help   = gives basic bot information.   <---->   example #help
